# üèóÔ∏è Add Sessions to the Login Route

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

- As a museum director, I want to allow visitors to view the gallery's paintings only after logging in.

- As a museum visitor, I want to be able to visit multiple pages while maintaining my logged-in status.

## Acceptance Criteria

- It's done when I can view the gallery's paintings only after I am logged in. Otherwise I am directed to log in.

- It's done when I can view the individual painting page only after I am logged in. Otherwise I am directed to log in.

- It's done when I can navigate from the gallery page to a painting's detail page without losing my logged-in status.

## Instructions

1. Create a .env file with your MySQL credentials. (Use `.env.EXAMPLE` as a template.)

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

3. Run `npm run seed` to seed the database.

4. Read the hints.

5. Update views to use `loggedIn` to conditionally render paintings and links.

6. Update routes use and manage `req.session.loggedIn`.

7. Reference the instructor demo, documentation, and ask questions if you are stuck.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates what the museum visitor sees if they try to access the gallery page without logging in:

## üí° Hints

- To test the routes, you should create your own test user.

- If the session variables are set up when the user is created or logged in, which file would hold that info?

- How can the templates know if the user is logged in or not?

- What built-in helper method will help us render specific content depending on whether the user is logged in or not?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

- What is the lifecycle of a session?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
