# HotRestaurant

## Notes

- You will NOT need a MySQL Database for this exercise.
- Current app doesn't have admin handling. We'll deal with that at a later time.
- Don't separate the JavaScript from the HTML in the client-side code. (i.e. Don't use external JavaScript. If you do, you will need an additional line of code to configure the express server to know where the JavaScript is).

## Good luck! Don't stress out

- Spend some time trying to build exposure. But don't get overwhelmed. We'll have plenty of time to come back to this.

## üèÜ Bonus

If by some miracle you finish early, feel encouraged to work on any one of these additional tasks to take your application to the next level.

- Add code to your server so that it "counts" every time a person visits any of the pages. Display a running count on the website.

- Add buttons for "checking off" individuals from the reservation list. Once this happens, the next person on the waitlist should be addd to the main reservation list.

- Add a button for sending emails to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use node-mailer or a similar npm package to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).

- Add a button for sending text messages to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use the Twilio library to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).
